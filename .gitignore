# Include Perch

# To include a subdirectory (perch/templates/) the parent directory needs 'unignoring'
# first. The first line unignores the perch directory, then the next ignores everything within 
# that directory. The third line then unignores the templates directory, and the following
# unignores the contents of that directory.
